### Project Description

This is an ad bannner created for a client from my previous work. The ad was made with Javascript with codes from an ad tracking API.

### Running the ad banner

To see the working ad banner in your web browser, do the following steps: 
  1. Choose from 3 sizes: 300x250, 160x600, 728x90
  2. Clone this repository to your preferred file location
  3. Create a local server in your computer
  4. Go to this location: [size] > master > cathayPacific_master_[size] > main.html
  
Your browser may block the ad banner from previewing due to the ad banner containing codes to track user impressions.
Disable tracking prevention in your browser to preview the ad banner
